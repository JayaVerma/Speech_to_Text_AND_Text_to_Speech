## Text to Speech
A Text-to-speech synthesizer is an application that converts text i.e. .txt file into spoken words. Here we have used Python Inbuild library of GTTS(Google Text-to-Speech) to convert  text into synthesized  speech and reads out to the user which can then be saved as an mp3.file in the same directory.
